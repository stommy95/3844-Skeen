            <p>
              Hello, my name is Tommy Skeen and I created this website to help describe the VT-shaped student as well as, my experiences and skills in the areas. As far as my experience in digital writing I do not have any formal training prior to my writing and digital media class which I am creating this website for. Furthermore, I love the actual concept of the VT-shaped individual in which you take the concept of the T-shaped individual that has taken weight in society and make it better by adding an extra layer. Down the line, this type of thinking for colleges needs to be common place to instill a better overall education into the lives of our kids to create a smarter and more efficient country and world.             
                </p>
            <h3 id="two">Goals and Interests</h3>
            <p> My life goals are not all that complicated like this philosophy, I just want to graduate and to find a decent job in the journalism world where I can leave my mark on that industry. However, I do not want to stop there, I want to enter the armed forces after college whether that is the air force or army I do not know but I wish to make a difference there in the world before I spend my life judging and placing judgement on others. I do not think this to be heroic, I just wish to serve my country before I try to carve out my own role into the civilian society we all know and love. Additionally, my interests as a student of Virginia Tech are simple as they start with athletics. One of my favorite or most remembered experiences will be either at a football game or in Cassel coliseum seeing the hokies beat a Duke basketball team. I also write word documents on my computer about current sports events and issues that no one sees but myself which I create in my spare time. This helps with my current digital writing class where I will finally be able to create a website with my own personal articles and experiences that not only myself will see. The work of a VT-shaped student does not only extend to his or her major requirements and requisites but it goes into how to implement your learning through research, engagement, and philanthropy or student-life opportunities. This student not only learns his role but furthers it with internships, research opportunities, partnerships, or graduate school to dispel your obstacles.         
                </p>
                
                
          <h3 id="three">My T and V Activites and Skills</h3>      
                <p>
                    My T activities and skills start with not only my major in multimedia journalism but also extends to my elective classes like indoor plants. So, my T skills include not only being able to write and edit documents but includes the many formats whether that’s Microsoft word or just another text editor. Furthermore, I know the many ways to clone a plant, when certain types of plants need certain amounts of water, or strictly where plants can go inside a house or building. For example, succulents which look like thorn-less cacti require much less water than say an orchid flower.  So, T activities not only make up your concentration but the other classes built to give you a diverse base of education to build upon. My V activities and skills start and end with my researching abilities. Additionally, most of my research skills come from my intro to research class but have been furthered by my own intuition. This means if I find the correct idea or concept I could start and finish a research plan to help the world in a specific area to learn more or influence the lives of people in the future.

                <h3 id="four">My Claim about the VT-shaped student</h3>
                <p>
                     I believe I exemplify what Virginia Tech meant by starting the VT-shaped individual because I have a diverse set of education which will help myself go into any field knowing I have the knowledge and mind set to succeed. Moreover, it starts with my major of multimedia journalism and rounds out with the additional classes I have taken whether that’s astronomy or advanced financial accounting because I use to be a business major. Finally, it ends with my knowledge of research which can be used to further our world underlining what was meant when they added the V to the T-shaped student.

                <article>
                    <h4>The vertical component of the T-shaped student</h4>
                    <p>
                       This component is described as your concentration in college or major. This part of the t are your disciplinary strengths or the measures that define people in society. Whether a student is an engineer, a pre-med student, a journalist, or a financial worker typically people are demarcated based on this level of the VT-shaped individual.  	
        </p>
                    <h4>The horizontal component of the T-shaped student</h4>
                    <p>
                        This component makes up all the other areas of your education whether that is your minor or your basic area requirements for general topics. This includes for myself classes I took like micro and macroeconomics, personal finance, astronomy, earth’s natural hazards, and indoor plants. But this part is not just general things, it is taught so you have a basic understanding of the world and its different industries or components. 
                    
                    </p>
                    <h4>The V of the VT-shaped student</h4>
                    <p>
                    	This area is the hardest to describe and it is also the newest idea going into this concept of the ideal student or learner. Furthermore, Virginia Tech added this area to the classic T-shaped student because they felt the idea was good but not finished for the world we live in today. This means that the v in this philosophy means it not only teaches you the information but, they want to show you what to do with this information and how to process it. For example, this area includes research abilities whether that is finding a topic or creating a platform in which you can create change to how the common person goes about life. This area includes extra levels of education like grad school and internships to help step-stone your way into the complex world we live in. It also includes the interconnected world with technology which is covered with the hands-on technique Virginia Tech gives its students to work with different industry-leading technology.

                    </p>
                    
                                       
                    <h4>Recommendations</h4>
                    <p>
                        Well although I see myself as a VT-shaped student I was not the best student for a while here at Virginia Tech. I urge all incoming students to not think about the present and your next weekend plans, but, to think about five maybe ten years from now and how you want to look back on your education. Did I even really give it my best? Did I accomplice everything I wanted? If I had only one suggestion to give is to go to EVERY class and to plan everything else around your homework and projects before you go and hit the town, because you never know what life might hold and you need to be ready for the real world.

              <h6>Description:</h6>
               <p>
                  I created this podcast to give some background on the T-shaped learner and its effect of students. This podcast describes the philosophy in detail showing the main two points shown as the horizontal component and the vertical component. These two devices describe different student perspectives as either your general education requisites/research abilities and major/concentration respectively.  As far as my claim goes this podcast reflects the T-part of the VT-shaped student model which I believe is the future of education in the United States because it gives the students an idea of what is required while also giving them an idea of the future. This is different from today because it is the parents for the most part that control a student’s education so, the students are not necessarily ready for big jumps they instead must take them as them come which can be overwhelming. As someone that has been a lifelong student I believe that helping the students of the future get an idea of what is actually expected of them will help instill a superior educated base of students in this country.

              <iframe width="100%" height="450" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/330568171&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false&amp;visual=true"></iframe>
                 
                   
                     <h5>Claim</h5>
                    <p> This podcast reflects the VT-shaped student model by describing the philosophy's effect on the future if implemented by all educational institutions. I believe I exemplify what Virginia Tech meant by starting the VT-shaped individual because I have a diverse set of education which will help myself go into any field knowing I have the knowledge and mind set to succeed. Moreover, it starts with my major of multimedia journalism and rounds out with the additional classes I have taken whether that’s astronomy or advanced financial accounting because I use to be a business major. Finally, it ends with my knowledge of research which can be used to further our world knowledge.
                    </p>
               <h5>Evidence </h5>
               <p>However, I believe that this philosophy does not only affect the institutions but it furthers the education of the students. By instilling the basis of the T-shaped philosophy you get a rounded out student who knows a great deal about his or her concentration and some core requisite information. This is only the beginning of the VT-shaped philosophy that adds a layer to create better researchers, gets students educated about jobs through internships, and knowing what field students can go into to succeed through other opportunites. Furthermore, all of these examples will help the future students be more than just participants in society but will make leaders in the world we know today.                  
               </p>
               <h5>Explanation</h5>
               <p>
                   Additionally, while I am taking the affirming stance on this philosophy it is not quite perfected becasue right now not many people have even heard about this learning-cycle. That is why I believe that this needs to be adopted by all institutions of learning because in order for this to create a better learning environment, it will not help if the students do not realize it is there to help them. So, as this generation of students comes and goes to create new parents these are the people that can take this philosophy to new hieghts because if you convince the parents it is best for the students then the rest will fall in place.
